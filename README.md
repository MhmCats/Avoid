# Avoid

Avoid is a game that I wrote in Python using the turtle library.

All the libraries used in it are default ones so there is no need to install anything...

## Running

If you wish to run it then type into your terminal (with git installed):

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/MhmCats/Avoid.git
$ cd Avoid/src
$ python3 main.py
```

Or if you are really lazy you could clone it and then run either `run.bat` or `run.sh`

Feel free to make your own levels but due to the weird implementation that I decided to use they might not turn out as planned...

## Bugs

If you find any bugs then please make a pull request or an issue.
